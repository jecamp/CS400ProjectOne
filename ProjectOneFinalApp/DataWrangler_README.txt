Files Written by Me:
--------------------
Movie.java, MovieDataReader.java, and TestMovieAndMovieDataReader.java

Movie.java: serves to define the movie object that is to be stored in the List outputed by the MovieDataReader, it includes all necessary getter methods of each property of a movie

MovieDataReader.java: serves to read data inserted by the backend and output the data as a list of Movie objects in the correct form

TestMovieAndMovieDataReader: serves as a tester class to test that the Movie.java and MovieDataReader.java is working properly and is outputing the expected data form when calling specific properties of the movie

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
I assisted in helping the backend developer debug with their test cases and integrating the backend code with the data wrangler code.
